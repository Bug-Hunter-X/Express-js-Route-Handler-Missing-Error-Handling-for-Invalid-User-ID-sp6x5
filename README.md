# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the provided code lacks proper checks to ensure the user ID is a valid number before attempting to parse and use it.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug
The original code fails to handle cases where the user ID is not a valid integer. This can result in unexpected behavior or application crashes.  The `parseInt()` function will return `NaN` if the input is not a number, causing errors in subsequent operations.

## Solution
The solution adds error handling to check if `req.params.id` can be safely parsed as an integer.  If parsing fails, or if no user is found, an appropriate HTTP error response is returned.
